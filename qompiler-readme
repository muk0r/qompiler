[About Qompiler]

	Qompiler is aimed to assist all mappers, novice and advanced, with compiling maps. 
	This is based on "Ultimate Quake Map Patcher" by Mankrip. (link below)
	Currently its set up to run with Ericw's "tyrutils-ericw" compiling tools. (link below)
	
[Instructions]
	- Create a folder named "Qompiler" inside your Quake folder. (or wherever you prefer)
	- Put the contents of this zip in the "Qompiler" folder.
	- If you dont already have them, download the latest "ericw-tools" compiling tools from the link in the bottom of this readme.
	- Extract "ericw-tools" to the "Qompiler" folder.
	- If you already have the tools, copy the 'bin' and 'doc' to the 'Qompiler' folder.
	- Take any map(s) you wish to (re)compile and put them in the "Qompiler" folder.
	- Double click "Qompiler.bat" to run Qompiler.
	- The following menu will display
	
	Lets Qompile some maps.

	1. [N]ew Configuration
	2. [L]oad Configuration
	3. [E]xtract Textures
	4. [Q]uick Qompile
	
	- Qompiler allows you to set options for each of the tools. It then saves those settings for you to use in the future.
	- Reference the "doc" folder included with "ericw-tools" for the settings you can apply.
	- Configs are saved as .BAT and are easily edited in a text editor.
	- Qompiler will prompt you if you didnt put things in the right place and will tell you what to correct.
	- If things are misplaced, Qompiler will prompt you to "Restart". Put the files in the correct spots, then restart.
	- Qompiled maps are put into Qompiler/Maps. Copy them into the Maps folder of your current game/mod. (ie id1/maps)
	- Quick Qompile allows you to apply settings without saving them to a config.
	
[Goals]

	I'd like for Qompiler to acheive the following goals:
	
	- Check for the existence of:
		a. qbsp.exe
		b. vis.exe
		c. light.exe
		d. .map files
		e. .bsp files
	- Allow the user to set options for compiling tools
		- The user is shown a list of settings and then types in the ones they desire. 
	- Move through each map on its own.
		- Perhaps make a "Prompt between each map" setting to allow the input of new map settings.
	- Tool Selection
		- Allow the user to completely turn off a tool.
	- Create Configs
		- Allow the user to create a series of configs or profiles to choose from. 
		Once the user sets values for the compiling tools, they will be prompted if they wish to save them to a config.
		During the next use of Qompiler the user will be prompted if they wish to use a config or create a new one.
