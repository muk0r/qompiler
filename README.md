# Qompiler
Qompiler, is the work Mukor and was inspired by Mankrips "Ultimate Quake Map Patcher" (http://quakedev.dcemulation.org/fragger/downloads/tools/uqmp.rar). 

Qompiler aims to help novice and advanced mappers alike. 

Currently, users are able to specifiy compiler settings and compile groups of maps. In the future, they will be able to save these settings to configs/profiles and will be prompted to execute them or to input new settings.
